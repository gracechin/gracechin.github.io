Disposable razors are a fast moving consumer good. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, two billion razors are thrown away every year. The aim was (i) to identify unsustainable aspects of razors and its manufacturing processes, and (ii) to propose a new design, while improving its sustainability footprint. The given task was to redesign disposable razor handles so that it followed a circular economic model to reduce waste and promote resource productivity. My idea was based on minimsing materials used and using recycled plastic.
