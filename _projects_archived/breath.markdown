The given challenge was to "design a portable device that can measure the lung tidal and residual volume". My main role was to design and make the look-alike prototype, which includes the user interface. Please see our [report]({{site.url}}/assets/pages/breath-report.pdf) to see sketches, 3D prototypes and the development process.
