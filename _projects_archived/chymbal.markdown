The _Chymbal_ combines a cymbal and chimes to create a sound-making machine. A user interface is provided to allow for viewers to compose their own chime-hitting pattern. The chimes are striked with a hitting mechanism creating harmonious sounds. The cymbal spins allowing the metal brushes to brush the cymbal and create a background sound.

It was decided that the chimes would follow the pentatonic scale as this would allow a harmonious sound to be played. With consideration to material, chime length and diameter using calculations and analysis, which is further described in the report, copper tubes were made into the appropriate length.

Different hitting mechanisms were experimented with, a DC motor-actuated one and a solenoid-actuated one. Due to the difficulty in controlling a hit using a motor, a solenoid-actuated hitting mechanism was chosen. After some iterations, the final hitting mechanism was created through laser cutting transparent acrylic. The solenoid was attached using metal brackets.

The slider was adapted from an Adafuit Bluetooth Camera slider. The components from the tutorial were 3D printed out of PLA and adjusted to fit the frame.

The frame was made from wood. A rubberband was added to the rack to ensure that the chimes can vibrate and resonate.

The interface was designed using Qt and the code was written using Python.

The cymbal was secured using rubber pieces and a clamping force. To design for the spinning, wheels were added under the cymbal and a motor was housed to directly rotate the axle.
