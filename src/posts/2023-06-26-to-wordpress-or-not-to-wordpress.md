In starting this blog, I tried out [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/).

---

It is a popularly-used and regularly-recommended content management system (CMS). While it is popular, there are people who have distanced themselves from it. For example, my web idol, _Lynn Fisher_, [migrated her blog away from WordPress](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/the-nbsp-was-breaking-after-all/). Also, an ex-colleague of mine, whom I look up to, strongly expressed his distaste for it. Despite other's feedback, I thought I'd give it a try.

After spending a couple of hours toying around and building my blog site, various small but inconvenient aspects of WordPress gradually surfaced.

### Pay For Design Freedom

The appearance of a WordPress site is dictated by a chosen `theme`. A theme takes the site's contents (e.g. text, images) and displays it using the theme's design. There are a multitude of opensourced themes to choose from which are customisable. But to customise certain aspects, you will need to pay. In another words, if you want to change the colour scheme, typography, add custom CSS, or more, you will need to pay.

Though it may be worth it for some people, I was not particularly keen on the idea of paying for limited flexibility (i.e. customisable themes) when I can have even more flexibility (i.e. not use WordPress and themes) for free.

### Not Exactly WYSIWYG

One of the main advantages advertised of WordPress is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) component of it. However, this is not exactly the case. While the differences between the editor preview and the actual site were minor, every little bit counted as a slight inconvenience.

### Pay For Removing a Banner

Finally, the last small thing which pushed me over the edge of deciding not to use WordPress was the banner. Before launching the site, I spent hours getting around the paid customisations through trying various themes and seeing how far I could go without paying. It wasn't until I thought the site was ready and clicked `Launch site` did WordPress revealed that there was going to be an advertisement banner.

To remove the advertisement banner, it required paying a monthly fee, which I was not keen to do.

### So, what now?

For my blog, I think I will stay away from coupled CMS for the sake of maximising flexibility and minimising costs.

Despite not using WordPress in the end, I'm glad I gave it a chance. Though I will not be using what I built in WordPress, it definitely did gave me an idea of what I want my blog to look like. I think if money wasn't an issue, WordPress may be worth it.
