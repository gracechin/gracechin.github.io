The aim of the project was to program a robot to feed a person autonomously. This involved identifying a person's face, mouth, and food. Baxter robot was controlled using Python and inverse kinematics. Unfortunately, due to time limitations, the task could not be fully executed, however, we made a great start.

The documentation for this project is shown [here][robotics-docs].
