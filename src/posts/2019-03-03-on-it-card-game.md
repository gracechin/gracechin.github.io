DA&D New Blood Award winning period education card game

---

[This project](https://www.dandad.org/awards/new-blood/2019/mckinsey-design-the-case-for-her/3444/on-it/) won a [D&AD New Blood Pencil award](https://www.dandad.org/profiles/jury/517866/mckinsey-design-the-case-for-her/) in 2019.

My talented university classmates and I developed a card game called _On It_ that focuses on period education. The objective of the game is to encourage conversation around menstruation, so that children do not feel isolated or ashamed. Our goal was to create a future where everyone feels comfortable with their body and its natural processes, starting with destigmatizing menstruation. The game features imaginative illustrations that were created using Adobe Illustrator.
