This is a random project I did during COVID times. At the time I was fascinated by [The Useless Web](https://theuselessweb.com/). The site would take me to all sorts of other websites that were "useless", and I would play and explore. Eventually, I wanted to make one too. A [Youtube tutorial](https://youtu.be/Sj1vbbRA07g) for [Pug in a Rug](https://puginarug.com/) inspired me to make one. The idea behind Gizmo the Cat was inspired by [Find the Invisible Cow](https://findtheinvisiblecow.com/) and a real cat I know called "Gizmo".

In _Find the Invisible Cow_, players find the cow through moving their mouse and hearing the word "Cow!". The shouting gets the louder as the mouse gets closer to the cow. In _Gizmo the Cat_, instead of using hearing to find the cat, players use their mouse as a "flashlight" to find the cat. This mimicked more of real-life in that occassionally Gizmo had to be found in the dark.

Gizmo is a neighbour's cat that likes to hide and roam into other people's house. This was quite annoying because it meant that Gizmo sometimes would get locked in to other people's house by accident. One time, it nearly got ran over because it was hiding behind one of the parked car's wheels. This is how I got the idea of finding Gizmo the aim of the game.
