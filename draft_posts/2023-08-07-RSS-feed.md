📚 Learning about RSS 🗞️ and adding it to this site ✨.

---

As someone who spends a majority of their time consuming content from social media, RSS was a completely new thing for me. I was first aware of it when seeing "RSS" subscribe buttons on dev blogs, which left me wondering _what is it?_ and _how can I subscribe to this blog using RSS?_.

Unlike the well-known social media platforms (e.g. Instagram, Twitter, Facebook), the content a user receives is completely under the user's control. When using web feeds, there are no ads, clickbaits, and algorithms. As [explained by Matt Webb][4]:

> No-one owns web feeds, so there’s no-one harvesting all the personal data and profiting off it

# What is RSS?

RSS stands for **R**eally **S**imple **S**yndication, or **R**ich **S**ite **S**ummary, or **R**DF **S**ite **S**ummary. RSS was invented in 1999 by pioneers at Netscape [(5)][5] as part of the rise in blogs in the early 2000s [(6)][6].

[RSS][1] (also known as _web feed_, _feed_, _RSS feed_) is a web feed that allows users to access new updates on websites in a standardised way. By subscribing to RSS feeds (e.g. feeds from podcasts, blogs and news sites), users can keep track of updates from a number of websites using a single platform called _aggregator_, _feed reader_, or _RSS reader_. The RSS feed provides content via XML while the RSS reader would process the XML.

# How do I use RSS?

I find [_About Feeds_ site][2] super useful in learning how to use RSS, especially if you are new to it like me!

# How I added RSS Feed to my 11ty site?

I pretty much followed [this blog post by conr][3]. I added `@11ty/eleventy-plugin-rss` plugin and a `feed.njk` to create an [online XML feed of this site](/feed.xml).
