<div class="about"><h1>About me</h1>
<p>I'm Grace Chin and I like designing and making things for the Internet. I love that I am always learning and growing when I am developing and coding. In my free time, I like to do <a href="/tags/projects/">projects</a>, which keep me on my toes and exploring.</p>
<p>Currently, I am on the lookout for a developer/designer position in the UK.</p>
<h2>How did I get here?</h2>
<p>I first acknowledged my passion for coding during my time in Imperial College
London, I graduated with a first class honours and earned my MEng degree in
Design Engineering. During the course, I did a variety of group design projects
that involved using different skills. I particularly enjoyed the coding aspects
of projects.</p>
<p>My interest in coding and working in a small company grew as I gained work
experience. During my 6-month work placement, I worked as a Junior Design
Engineer for an AI start-up in London. I had fun working with a small team of
people. After graduating in 2019, I spent two years at a Hong Kong fintech
start-up, where I was first a Junior Software Developer and later a Software
Engineer. From working in tech start-ups, <a href="http://localhost:8080/posts/2023-04-24-working-for-startups/">I learnt a lot about development</a> from the experienced people there.</p>
<p>Curious on how technology and design can help people, I spent over a year as a
human-computer interaction design researcher at the School of Design in Hong
Kong Polytechnic University. While I learnt a lot from being a researcher, I
missed bringing creative concepts to life through my design and coding skills,
as well as the UK. Hence, now I am looking for new opportunities in the UK.</p>
<h2>Outside of coding</h2>
<p>I live with my husband, Dan. In our spare time, we like to walk and have
walked the the big four trails of Hong Kong.</p>
