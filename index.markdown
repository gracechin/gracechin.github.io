<p>
    As a designer and developer, I've had the opportunity to work with tech startups, bringing creative concepts to life through my design and coding skills. 
</p>
<p>
    Outside of work, I have an assortment of personal projects that keeps me exploring, learning, and creating. My all-time favourite projects are the ones where I have the privilege to help people and charities, such as the UK mental health charity, Mind.
</p>
<p>
    Currently, I'm seeking a designer / developer position in the UK that I can start in late July / early August 2023.
