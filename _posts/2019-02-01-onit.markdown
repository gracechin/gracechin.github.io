On It is a period education card game. The game aims to open dialogue about menstruation allowing children to not feel isolated. We envision a future where everyone can feel comfortable about their own body and its natural processes, starting with destigmatising menstruation. The card game is filled with creative illustrations that engages children. The game is currently being developed and tested. So far there has been very promising feedback from parents, teachers, and children.
