Currently, I am in the process of moving from Hong Kong to the UK, and am seeking a developer / designer position that can start in late July / early August 2023.

## How did I get here

In 2019, I graduated from Imperial College London, where I earned my MEng degree in Design Engineering. As part of the four-year program, I had the opportunity to spend three months as a Junior Design Engineer for an AI start-up in London. Having enjoyed working in a startup and coding in my program, for my first full-time job, I worked two years as a Junior Software Developer in a Hong Kong fintech start-up and was later promoted to being a Software Engineer.

Curious on how technology and design can help people, I spent over a year as a human-computer interaction design researcher in Hong Kong Polytechnic University's School of Design. While I learnt a lot from being a researcher and was fascinated by the research area, I miss bringing creative concepts to life through my design and coding skills, as well as the UK. Hence, now I am looking for new opportunities in the UK.

## Outside of what I do

I live with my husband, Dan, who is very excited to be moving back to the UK. We like to walk and have walked the the big four trails of Hong Kong.
