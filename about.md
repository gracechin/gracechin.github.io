Currently, I am in the process of relocating from Hong Kong to the UK, and am on the lookout for a developer/designer role that can start in late July/early August 2023.

## How did I get here

My passion for technology and design has been a constant throughout my career. In 2019, I graduated with a first class honours from Imperial College London, where I earned my MEng degree in Design Engineering. During my studies, I worked as a Junior Design Engineer for an AI start-up in London, which sparked my interest in coding and start-up culture. I then spent two years as a Junior Software Developer at a Hong Kong fintech start-up, where I was promoted to Software Engineer. Curious on how technology and design can help people, I spent over a year as a human-computer interaction design researcher at the School of Design in Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

While I learnt a lot from being a researcher, I miss bringing creative concepts to life through my design and coding skills, as well as the UK. Hence, now I am looking for new opportunities in the UK.

## Outside of what I do

I live with my husband, Dan. In our spare time, we like to walk and have walked the the big four trails of Hong Kong.
