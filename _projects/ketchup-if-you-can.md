_Ketchup If You Can_ is a toy designed to rehabilitate children aged 5-12 with hemiplegic cerebral palsy. The game is inspired from an existing game, _Bop It!_. The ketchup-themed toy instructs the player to do a certain move. If the player does the move correctly within a time limit a rewarding audio and haptic feedback would be given to the player. The game increases in difficulty by reducing the time limit as the player levels up.

The moves (squeeze, twist, shake, and flip) chosen incorporated in the game based on common movements in bimanual activities. The bottle is designed to encourage the use of two hands, which is important for children with cerebral palsy that may be relutant to use their weaker hands.

Interest among experts on the device has been expressed during the presentation. Further work and testing were suggested by the experts because of its potential.
