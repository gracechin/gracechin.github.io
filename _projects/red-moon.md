_[Red Moon](https://track-your-red-moon.netlify.app/)_ was created from my personal desire to track my menstrual cycle digitally using the _Fertility Awareness Method (FAM)_. While there are plenty of period tracking applications, they do not all support the FAM approach to tracking. Of the ones that do support the FAM method, I found that some were costly and others do not have the features I wanted. As a result, I resorted to recording several cycles using paper and pen.

To satisfy my own wants and needs digitally, I developed _Red Moon_, which is designed to track menstrual cycles using the FAM one cycle at a time.
