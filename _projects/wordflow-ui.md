For this project, I have so far worked for [DeepTranslate](https://deeptranslate.hk/) for around a month. DeepTranslate is a start-up company that specialises in translating financial documents using artificial intelligence. The objective of this project was to revamp the UI/UX of their web application, _Wordflow_, to make it more user-friendly and enable users to translate collaborative documents with ease.

To begin the project, I first used the existing UI to identify any issues and then consulted with the sales team to understand user requirements. I came across several issues with the UI/UX, two of which are highlighted in the screenshots below:

Looking at the above screenshot, intuitively, you would think that the edit button (the pencil icon) would be to edit various configuration of a project when in fact it only edits the project name.

![Wordflow UI Manage sections](/assets/pages/wordflow-ui/manage-sections.png)

In the above screenshot, it is not intuitive that clicking the "+" next to the _Sections_ heading will not add a new section. Instead, users have to drag and drop the "+" into the empty space below.

After identifying user needs and issues with the existing UI/UX, I redesigned it using Figma and conducted iterative tests and consultations with the sales team. I documented the user flow and expected behaviors to communicate the design to the front-end developers.
