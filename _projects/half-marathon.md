Thanks to the contributions of all the donors, we raised over 600 pounds for [_Mind_](https://www.mind.org.uk/) (a mental health charity)!

To raise funds and awareness, I documented my running training journey through [a blog](https://www.facebook.com/gracerunningformind/), where I shared short comics and photos with supporters.
