title: To WordPress Or Not To WordPress

In starting this blog, I decided I would take this opportunity to try out and give my verdict on [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). It is a popularly-used and recommended content management system.

While there are definitely people who like WordPress, I also know people who dislike it. For example, my web artist idol, _Lynn Fisher_, wrote a [post](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/the-nbsp-was-breaking-after-all/) regarding her blog migration away from WordPress. A previous colleague of mine, whom I looked up to, also expressed his distaste for WordPress. Despite these warnings, I thought "_It can't be that bad if it's that popular_" and decided to give it a go.

After spending a couple hours toying around and building my blog site, like Lynn, various small but irritating aspects in WordPress slowly surfaced:

### Pay For Design Freedom

The appearance of a WordPress site is dictated by a selected `theme`, which displays the site's contents (e.g. text, images) in the specific theme's design. There are a multitude of opensourced themes to choose from and you can customise any chosen theme to your liking as long as you pay. In another words, if you want to change the colour scheme, typography, add custom CSS, or more, you will need to pay.

Though it may be worth it for some people, I was not particularly keen on the idea of paying for limited flexibility (i.e. customisable themes) when I can have even more flexibility (i.e. not use WordPress and themes) for free.

### Not Exactly WYSIWYG

One of the main advantages advertised of WordPress is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) component of it. However, this is not exactly the case. While the differences between the editor preview and the actual site were minor, every little bit counted as a slight inconvenience.

### Pay For Removing a Banner

Finally, the last small thing which pushed me over towards not using WordPress was the banner. Before launching the site, I was busy spending hours getting around the paid customisations through trying various themes and seeing how far I could go without paying. It wasn't until I thought "_Okay, I have checked the site preview. I think I am happy with how it looks!_" and clicked `Launch site` does WordPress reveal that there was going to be an advertisement banner.

To remove the advertisement banner, it required paying a monthly fee, which I was not keen to do. As opposed to paying to gain something, I would be paying to remove something that not using WordPress would already give me.

### So, what now?

For my blog, I think I will stay away from content management systems for the sake of maximising flexibility and minimising costs.

Despite not using WordPress in the end, I am happy I gave it a chance. Though I will not be using what I designed in WordPress, it definitely did give me an idea of what I want my blog to look like. I think if payment wasn't an issue, WordPress would probably be worth the hype.
