title: To WordPress Or Not To WordPress

In starting a blog, I decided I would try out [WordPress.com](https://wordpress.com/). It is a popularly-used and regularly-recommended content management system. While it is popular, there are people who dislike it. For example, my web idol, _Lynn Fisher_, [migrated her blog away from WordPress](https://lynnandtonic.com/thoughts/entries/the-nbsp-was-breaking-after-all/). Also, an ex-colleague of mine, whom I look up to, strongly expressed his distaste for it. Despite these warnings, I thought "_It can't be that bad if it's that popular_" and decided to give it a try.

After spending a couple of hours toying around and building my blog site, various small but irritating aspects of WordPress slowly surfaced.

### Pay For Design Freedom

The appearance of a WordPress site is dictated by a chosen `theme`. A theme takes the site's contents (e.g. text, images) and displays it using the theme's design. There are a multitude of opensourced themes to choose from which are customisable. But to customise certain aspects, you will need to pay. In another words, if you want to change the colour scheme, typography, add custom CSS, or more, you will need to pay.

Though it may be worth it for some people, I was not particularly keen on the idea of paying for limited flexibility (i.e. customisable themes) when I can have even more flexibility (i.e. not use WordPress and themes) for free.

### Not Exactly WYSIWYG

One of the main advantages advertised of WordPress is WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) component of it. However, this is not exactly the case. While the differences between the editor preview and the actual site were minor, every little bit counted as a slight inconvenience.

### Pay For Removing a Banner

Finally, the last small thing which pushed me over the edge of deciding not to use WordPress was the banner. Before launching the site, I spent hours getting around the paid customisations through trying various themes and seeing how far I could go without paying. It wasn't until I thought the site was ready and clicked `Launch site` did WordPress revealed that there was going to be an advertisement banner.

To remove the advertisement banner, it required paying a monthly fee, which I was not keen to do. As opposed to paying to gain something, I would be paying to remove something that not using WordPress would give me.

### So, what now?

For my blog, I think I will stay away from content management systems for the sake of maximising flexibility and minimising costs.

Despite not using WordPress in the end, I'm glad I gave it a chance. Though I will not be using what I built in WordPress, it definitely did gave me an idea of what I want my blog to look like. I think if money wasn't an issue, WordPress may be worth the hype.
