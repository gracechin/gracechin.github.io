My first-ever version of my website was in 2019, just after I graduated from college. The website lasted me through my first job. Below is a screenshot of what it looked like. Back then, I kept the style minimalistic and chic. Many of the projects showcased were past university projects.

Last year, I created a new version of my website using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It all started when I came across [Ian Li's website](https://www.ianli.com/) during my time as a researcher. I really liked the website because, although the design is simple, clean, and easy to understand, it still manages to present character and individuality through the color scheme, illustrations, and layout. I also enjoyed looking through the fun personal projects.

Inspired by the website and his work, I dug into his GitHub account to get some hints on how he implemented his website. That was when I was first introduced to Jekyll! After some self-learning and trial-and-error, I am now a fan of Jekyll. Unlike how my original website ([source code](https://github.com/gracechin/gracechin.github.io/tree/0177e838e07e2a3edfa77010c18471b045b701bf)) was built, which involved a fair amount of copy-and-pasting HTML code (e.g., for the navigation bar and footer), Jekyll produces a complete static website based on given content and templates. Using Jekyll reduced code repetition and allowed for easier content management of the website.
