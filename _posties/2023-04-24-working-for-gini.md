title: What I learnt from working for start-ups

To help myself remember what I have learned and my experiences from working with various start-ups, I thought it might be helpful to write them down. Here they are!

**I learnt...**

- **...how to use git.** The first time I created a pull request on GitHub, it was intimidating. But now, I feel much more confident in using Git. I really appreciate the workflow and how it allows coders to collaboratively work on the same project. By letting others review my code and reviewing others' code, I have learned a lot.
- **...how to write clean code.** From watching [Uncle Bob](http://cleancoder.com/products)'s videos, which were introduced to me by an experienced developer, I learnt good coding practices (e.g. writing tests).
- **...the importance of a good work space.** This is something I didn't think was as important before. I learnt the value of keyboard shortcuts, essential keyboard configurations (e.g. changing the `Caps Lock` key to `Control` for easy access of keys), time-saving development environment plugins, and ways to make the terminal easier to work with (e.g. [Fish](https://fishshell.com/), [Oh My Zsh](https://ohmyz.sh/)). Apart from these practical tips, I found that each developer in the start-ups had their own individualized desk things (i.e., clickety-clack keyboards, mouse/touchpad, fidget toys, headphones, fun mugs), which spoke to each developer's personality and inspired me to invest in a set of my own.
- **...how to use an Apple laptop.** Being cheap, I never owned a personal Mac laptop prior to working in these start-ups. Using an Apple laptop for work has successfully convinced me to purchase my own Apple laptop.
- **...how to strive for a CI/CD or Agile work flow.** This involves automating tests as much as possible to shorten the systems development work cycle. I remember, at one point, I had to implement end-to-end tests by simulating what a user would do for various use cases to make the development cycle more efficient.
- **...what project management looks like.** The different start-ups used different project management systems like Trello, Jira, and Notion. In appreciation of the satisfaction of moving the tasks to done, I have also incorporated these systems into my personal life as well via Notion.

That's it for now! No doubt, there is still lots to learn...
