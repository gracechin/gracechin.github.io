In starting a new chapter in my career (hopefully starting a new job soon), it's probably a good time to revamp my website.

### In memory of my past websites

My first ever version of my website was in 2019, which was when I first graduated from college. The website lasted me through my first job. Below shows a screenshot of what it looked like. Back then, I kept the style minimalistic and chic. I included many of my past university projects since I didn't have many work projects to showcase.

Last year, I created a new version of my website using [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com/). It all started when I came across [Ian Li's website](https://www.ianli.com/) during my time as a researcher. I really liked the website because though the design is simple, clean, and easy to understand, it still manages to present character and individuality through the colour scheme, illustrations, and layout. I also really enjoyed looking through the fun personal projects.

Inspired by the website and his work, I digged into his Github account to get some hints on how he implemented his website. That was when I was first introduced to [Jeckyll](http://jekyllrb.com/)! After some self-learning and trial-and-error, I am now a fan on Jeckyll. Unlike how my original website ([source code](https://github.com/gracechin/gracechin.github.io/tree/0177e838e07e2a3edfa77010c18471b045b701bf)) was built, which involved a fair amount of copy-and-pasting HTML code (e.g. the navigation bar, and footer), Jeckyll produces a complete static website based on given content and templates. Using Jeckyll reduced code repetition and allowed for easier content management of the website.

### For this revamp

I am inspired by the [lynnandtonic website (2023)](https://lynnandtonic.com/) and have been fangirling about it. Not only does it showcase really cool and fun projects, it also impressively showcase annual iterations of the website in the [`Archive`](https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/) page. I am especially impressed by the wild and imaginative digital easter eggs on the websites (e.g. re-sizing the window to show animations, dragging and dropping icons to change theme of components).
