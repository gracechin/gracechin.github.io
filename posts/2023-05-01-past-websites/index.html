      <h1>My Past Website Developments</h1>

    <div><p>Inspired by <a href="https://lynnandtonic.com/archive/">lynnandtonic's Archive</a>, in this post, I share various versions of my website.</p>
<h3>2019</h3>
<p>My first-ever version of my website was in 2019, just after I graduated from college. The website lasted me through my first job. I remember it being the first time using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> to make my website responsive. Back then, I tried to keep the style minimalistic, clean, and chic. Many of the projects showcased were past university projects.</p>

<em>My 2019 website</em></p>
<h3>2022</h3>
<p>In 2022, I updated my website and used <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a> for my very first time. It all started when I came across <a href="https://www.ianli.com/">Ian Li's website</a> during my time as a researcher. I really liked the design of the website. Though the design is simple, clean, and easy to understand, it still manages to present character and individuality through the colour scheme, illustrations, and layout. I also enjoyed looking through the fun personal projects.</p>
<p>Inspired by the website and his work, I dug into his GitHub account to get some hints on how he implemented his website. That was when I was first introduced to Jekyll! After some self-learning and trial-and-error, I am now a fan of Jekyll. Unlike how my original website (<a href="https://github.com/gracechin/gracechin.github.io/tree/0177e838e07e2a3edfa77010c18471b045b701bf">source code</a>) was built, which involved a fair amount of copy-and-pasting HTML code (e.g., for the navigation bar and footer), Jekyll produces a complete static website based on given content and templates. Using Jekyll reduced code repetition and allowed for easier content management of the website.</p>

<h3>Next</h3>
<p>That's pretty much all the major developments I made since I first started this website! 'Till the next time I decide to iterate on this website!</p>
