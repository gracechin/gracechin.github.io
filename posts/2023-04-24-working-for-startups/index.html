      <h1>What I Learnt From Working For Start-ups</h1>
      <span>Apr 24, 2023</span>
    </header>
    <div><p>To help myself remember what I have learned and my experiences from working with various start-ups, I thought it might be helpful to write them down. Here they are!</p>
<p><strong>I learnt...</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>...how to use git.</strong> The first time I created a pull request on GitHub, it was intimidating. But now, I feel much more confident in using Git. I really appreciate the workflow and how it allows coders to collaboratively work on the same project. By letting others review my code and reviewing others' code, I have learned a lot.</li>
<li><strong>...how to write clean code.</strong> From watching <a href="http://cleancoder.com/products">Uncle Bob</a>'s videos, which were introduced to me by an experienced developer, I learnt good coding practices (e.g. writing tests).</li>
<li><strong>...the importance of a good work space.</strong> This is something I didn't think was as important before. I learnt the value of keyboard shortcuts, essential keyboard configurations (e.g. changing the <code>Caps Lock</code> key to <code>Control</code> for easy access of keys), time-saving development environment plugins, and ways to make the terminal easier to work with (e.g. <a href="https://fishshell.com/">Fish</a>, <a href="https://ohmyz.sh/">Oh My Zsh</a>). Apart from these practical tips, I found that each developer in the start-ups had their own individualized desk things (i.e., clickety-clack keyboards, mouse/touchpad, fidget toys, headphones, fun mugs), which spoke to each developer's personality and inspired me to invest in a set of my own.</li>
<li><strong>...how to use an Apple laptop.</strong> Being cheap, I never owned a personal Mac laptop prior to working in these start-ups. Using an Apple laptop for work has successfully convinced me to purchase my own Apple laptop.</li>
<li><strong>...how to strive for a CI/CD or Agile work flow.</strong> This involves automating tests as much as possible to shorten the systems development work cycle. I remember, at one point, I had to implement end-to-end tests by simulating what a user would do for various use cases to make the development cycle more efficient.</li>
<li><strong>...what project management looks like.</strong> The different start-ups used different project management systems like Trello, Jira, and Notion. In appreciation of the satisfaction of moving the tasks to done, I have also incorporated these systems into my personal life as well via Notion.</li>
</ul>
<p>That's it for now! No doubt, there is still lots to learn...</p>
